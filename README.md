This is second project from FreeCodeCamp. The goal of the project was to make a markdown previewer with interactive input.<br/>


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
Tests are written in jest enzyme technology
